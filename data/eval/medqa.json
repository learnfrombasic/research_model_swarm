She endorses sleeping outside, using minimal bug spray, and swimming in rivers during her tour. On physical exam, her temperature is 101.5, and she appears exhausted. She has a hive-like rash scattered over her body. Her abdominal exam is notable for hepatosplenomegaly, and her lung exam is notable for scattered crackles.

They designed a cohort study that included 68 individuals: 34 exposed and 34 unexposed to given risk factors, who were followed up for 4 years in total. During this time, the renal disease of interest was seen in 6 individuals among the exposed group and 6 individuals among the unexposed group; thus, the risk ratio (RR) of the disease development (exposed vs. unexposed) was 1. During the initial 2 years, there was 1 death in the exposed group, and another death in the unexposed group. A survey administered for the last 2 years of the study showed that the prevalence ratio of disease between exposed and unexposed individuals was in fact 0.5 (at 2 years of follow-up there was only 1 case of the disease in the 34 exposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 2.94%; and only 2 cases of the disease in the 34 unexposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 5.88%), a value that deviates from the true RR (i.e. 1).\n\nQuestion: For this reason (and to accurately answer the research question), the risk of the disease should be estimated in terms of which of the following?",

The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is not significantly obstructed. Prior to the angiogram, he underwent a pharmacologic cardiac stress test. When administered, the pharmacologic agent caused the left circumflex artery to vasodilate, with resulting increased blood supply to its supplied myocardium that was already well-perfused at baseline. This increased flow through the circumflex artery shunted blood flow away from the myocardium supplied by the stenosed left anterior descending artery, resulting in ischemia that manifested as a perfusion defect on radionuclide imaging.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following agents is most strongly associated with this phenomenon described above?",
